# Bugs
- dropped images too big for the view (set metadata size)
- Zoom : Fit to screen does not work, just zooms to 100%
- Page : Add .. should prompt you for a name
- assets view: sometimes the image is to large for the window
- assets view: remove the unnecessary crop panel, use the same button to start and end the crop


# Todo
- Splash Screen
- Update settings ui
- Add some way to switch pages  quickly with the mouse
